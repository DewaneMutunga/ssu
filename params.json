{"name":"Sans Sidebar Underscores","tagline":"A Full-width, Sidebar-less HTML Structure for the Underscores Starter Theme by Automattic.","body":"Sans Sidebar Underscores\r\n===\r\n\r\nHi. I'm a starter theme called `Sans Sidebar Underscores`, a tweaked version of the `_s` theme from Automattic. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.\r\n\r\nMy ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:\r\n\r\n* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.\r\n* A helpful 404 template.\r\n* A sample custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.\r\n* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.\r\n* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.\r\n* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.\r\n* 2 sample CSS layouts in `layouts` for a sidebar on either side of your content.\r\n* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.\r\n* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.\r\n\r\nWhat Is Sans Sidebar Underscores\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n`Sans Sidebar Underscores` is a exactly what its name implies on the surface, a sidebar-less version of Automattic's `_s` starter theme. You can find it here: https://github.com/Automattic/_s/\r\n\r\nI created this variation of Underscores because I wanted to have an easier way to customize the theme's default layout, mainly removing the sidebar. \r\n\r\n`Sans Sidebar Underscores` allows you to remove the sidebar by simply checking a box in the WordPress Theme Customizer. In addition to this option, I've also added other options for your convenience that will make it super easy to customize content in various places around the theme. \r\n\r\nThis variation of Underscores also has a full-width HTML structure. This was done with the intention of making is easier for designers to create \"full-width\" designs that span across the entire width of a given viewport.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n`Sans Sidebar Underscores` gives you the option of either using the \"SSU\" slug I created, or manually making one of your own.\r\n\r\nIf you want to set things up manually, download `Sans Sidebar Underscores` from github. The first thing you want to do is copy the `ssu-master` directory and change the name to something else - Like, say, `megatherium` - then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.\r\n\r\n1. Search for `'ssu'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.\r\n2. Search for `ssu_` to capture all the function names.\r\n3. Search for <code>&nbsp;ssu</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.\r\n4. Search for `ssu-` to capture prefixed handles.\r\n5. Search for `Text Domain: ssu` in style.css.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n* Search for: `'ssu'` and replace with: `'megatherium'`\r\n* Search for: `ssu_` and replace with: `megatherium_`\r\n* Search for: <code>&nbsp;ssu</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium</code>\r\n* Search for: `ssu-` and replace with: `megatherium-`\r\n* Search for: `Text Domain: ssu` and replace with: `Text Domain: megatherium` in style.css.\r\n\r\nThen, update the stylesheet header in style.css and the links in footer.php with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.\r\n\r\nNow you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
